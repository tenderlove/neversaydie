= NeverSayDie

* http://seattlerb.rubyforge.org
* http://github.com/tenderlove/neversaydie

== DESCRIPTION:

NEVER SAY DIE lets you rescue from segmentation faults.  Got a SEGV, don't
worry about it anymore!  Just rescue an exception and get on with life.  Who
cares about getting a SEGV anyway?  It's just memory.  I mean, when I was in
school, I didn't need 100% to pass the class.  Why should your memory need to
be 100% correct to get the job done?  A little memory corruption here and there
doesn't hurt anyone.

So go for it!  Kick back, grab a beer, require the NEVER SAY DIE gem and let
your problems go away sometimes!

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Oh so many problems...
* Portability...
* Not solving the root cause..
* It might not work.
* Massive security hole
* Just to name a few

== SYNOPSIS:

I will let the (passing) test speak for itself:

  assert_raises NeverSayDie do
    NeverSayDie.segv
  end

Here is the source of the segv method:

  static VALUE segv(VALUE self)
  {
    int *ptr = NULL;
    *ptr = 1;
  
    return self;
  }

== REQUIREMENTS:

* libsigsegv

== INSTALL:

First, install libsigsegv.  If you're on OS X, do this:

  $ sudo port install libsigsegv

I'm not sure about other platforms.  Then install the gem:

  $ sudo gem install neversaydie

== pry-rescue

If you do this:

  $ sudo gem install pry-rescue

Then you run a segfaulting program, wrapped like this:

  require 'pry-rescue'
  Pry.rescue do
    # errant thing goes here.
  end

You will then be able to inspect local variables, re-send the failing method
calls, etcetera. In other words, you will get the full powers of Pry even for
errors causing SIGSEGV.
